        <h4>Self Introduction</h4>
        <p>Hi, my name is Aurelia Keberle and I am a senior at the Engineering and Science University Magnet School in West Haven, Connecticut. I made this game as a part of my class: Digital Media for Social Change.</p>
        <h4>Definition of a Game</h4>
        <p> game--something that people play in order to have fun/engage with other people through a common thing; it has a set of rules everyone must follow</p>
        <h4>My Gamer Types</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>67% Explorer</li>
            <li>67% Socializer</li>
            <li>53% Killer</li>
            <li>13% Achiever</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>My Favorite Games</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Monopoly-- I like the similarity with real life and the practice in financial literacy</li>
            <li>Cards Against Humanity-- I like the boldness players are inspired to implore and the free choice nature of the game. I also like that every game is different and it is always interesting to see where a game will go.</li>
        </ol>
